    "**Q5**. In order to fit a [LightFM](https://lyst.github.io/lightfm/docs/home.html) model, we need to transform our Dataframe to a sparse matrix (cf. below). This is not straightforward so we included the function `df_to_matrix` in `utils.py`.\n",

    "> 🔦 **Hint**:  Sparse matrices are just **big matrices with a lot of zeros or empty values**.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Existing tools (Pandas DataFrame, Numpy arrays for example) are not suitable for manipulating this kind of data. So we will use [Scipy sparse matrices](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/sparse.html).\n",

    "> 🔦 **Hint 2**:  By going from a DataFrame to a sparse matrix, you will lose the information of the ids (userId and movieId), you will only deal with indices (row number and column number). Therefore, the `df_to_matrix` function also returns dictionaries mapping indexes to ids (ex: uid_to_idx mapping userId to index of the matrix) \n",
